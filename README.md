# Solution Code: Basic Sentiment Analysis App

This project showcases a simple Flask-based Sentiment Analysis API leveraging the TextBlob library. Additionally, it demonstrates a simulated AI model with a logging decorator that tracks the input and output during predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:Thinkful-Ed/solution-code-flask-endpoints-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```shell
   cd solution-code-flask-endpoints-project
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment:
   * On macOS and Linux:
     ```shell
     python -m venv flask_endpoints_project_env
     ```
   * On Windows:
     ```shell
     python -m venv flask_endpoints_project_env
     ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   * On macOS and Linux:
     ```shell
     source flask_endpoints_project_env/bin/activate
     ```
   * On Windows:
     ```shell
     .\flask_endpoints_project_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages (Flask should be in the `requirements.txt`):
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. To run the Sentiment Analysis API:
   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

Upon launching the API, navigate to `localhost:5000` to see a welcome message. For sentiment analysis, use the route `localhost:5000/analyze_sentiment/YourTextHere`.

## Description

The Sentiment Analysis API provides sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for any given text. The repository also contains a simple AI model simulation with two functions (`run_ai_model_sum` and `run_ai_model_minus`). These functions are decorated with `log_io`, which prints input and output values to the console.

## Notes

While the Flask API can be accessed via a browser or tools like Postman, the AI model simulation is designed for demonstration purposes. Running the code will execute the AI model functions, and you'll observe the logging in action.
